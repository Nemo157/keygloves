 * Chorded keyboard gloves
   * 2 master points, top of thumbs
   * 16 trigger points, tops and midpoints of fingers
   * 2-stroke chords, 16**2 combinations, 256 key codes
 * Combine chord easiness map + common characters
   * Common characters
     * Use my personal github repos?
     * Include commonly used vim shortcuts?
   * Could extend to multiple characters, 2- 3- 4-combo chords with common
     character strings
     * Depending on corpus, wonder how high this could be perfectly solved for
       and if there are good heuristic solutions for higher combos
   * Probably pay to have some force added chords, e.g. numbers might work best
     as forced to be counted up the fingers.
 * Hardware
   * 18 basic GPIOs
   * Small enough to fit comfortably embedded in glove on back of hand.
   * Bluetooth so it can appear as a BT keyboard
   * Battery powered
     * where does the battery go?
     * movement based charging battery?
     * BT energy harvesting?
